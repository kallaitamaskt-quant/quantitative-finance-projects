1. Equity Market Data Analysis

File: market_analysis.py

Description: An introductory Python script that downloads historical stock price data using the yfinance library. It then calculates and visualizes key metrics such as daily returns and simple moving averages to practice foundational data manipulation and analysis techniques with pandas and matplotlib.

To Run: Ensure you have the required libraries installed (pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib) and then execute the script from your terminal: python market_analysis.py.
