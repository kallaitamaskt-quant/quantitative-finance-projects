Quantitative Finance Projects

This repository contains a collection of my personal projects focused on quantitative finance, data analysis, and algorithmic strategy, developed as part of my self-study curriculum.

1. Equity Market Data Analysis
A beginner python script that downloads historical stock price data using the yfinance library. It then calculates and visualizes metrics such as daily returns and simple moving averages to practice data manipulation and analysis techniques with pandas and matplotlib.

File: market_analysis.py

To Run: Ensure you have the required libraries installed, and then execute the script from your terminal.
